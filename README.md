# Lu√≠sinho010: Aspiring Computer Scientist

**Hello!** 

I'm Lu√≠s, a passionate 18-year-old aspiring computer scientist eager to make my mark in the tech world. Currently finishing high school, I'm honing my skills in various programming languages, including Haxe, Java, Python, Lua, C, and C++.

**My Goals:**

* **Master C and C++:** While I'm already familiar with Haxe, I'm excited to delve deeper into the world of C and C++ for their versatility and performance in computer science applications.
* **Build Real-World Projects:** I'm looking to apply my knowledge to create meaningful projects that solve problems and make a difference.

**Let's Connect:**

* **Discord:** Feel free to reach out on Discord at `luis_claudio01`.

**Looking Forward:**

I'm always open to learning new things and collaborating with other developers. Let's build something amazing together!
